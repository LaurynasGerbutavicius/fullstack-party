But sometime, the env variable does not have to be a variable. In that case, developer uses a fake env variables to get the result.\r\n\r\nFor instance (from the documentation and blog posts)\r\n\r\n```\r\nparameters:\r\n    env(AUTH_FILE): '../config/auth.json'\r\ngoogle:\r\n    auth: '%env(file:AUTH_FILE)%'\r\n```\r\nor \r\n```\r\nparameters:\r\n    env(HEALTH_CHECK_METHOD): 'Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request::METHOD_HEAD'\r\nsecurity:\r\n   access_control:\r\n     - { path: '^/health-check$', methods: '%env(const:HEALTH_CHECK_METHOD)%' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to decouple env reading from parameter processing.

So when using the serialisation using setters I get and the end a Child Object with an attribute games that is an array of several Game instances.\r\nHowever for design reasons it is not possible to use the setters so I had to use the serialisation through the constructor, hence on my constructor I have someting like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nclass Child\r\n{\r\n\r\n/**\r\n     * @var Game[]\r\n     */\r\n    private $games;\r\n\r\n   /**\r\n     * Child constructor.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param Game[] $games\r\n     */\r\n    public function __construct(\r\n        array $games,\r\n    ) {\r\n        $this->games = $games;\r\n    }\r\n }\r\n```\r\n### **setter denormalization**\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the denormalizer could not figure out that the games is an array of objects from the class **Game** and then I get instead of an object an array have the same attributes defined on the **Game** class which is not the same when I add a setter for the games.\r\n\r\nWhen I debug it the code fro both setter serialization and constructor serialization  I can see the difference between both methods getting into action.\r\n\r\n- For the first case of the **setter denormalization** the function **validateAndDenormalize** from the **AbstractObjectNormalizer** is handling the normalization and there is the code there is a check on the collection type   `if ($type->isCollection() && null !== ($collectionValueType = $type->getCollectionValueType()) && Type::BUILTIN_TYPE_OBJECT === $collectionValueType->getBuiltinType())` which can determine if the array has objects from a defined class.\r\n\r\nAdding a setter like that is enough to get the right denormalization:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      /**\r\n      * @param Game[] $games\r\n      * @return Child\r\n     */\r\n     public function setGames(array $games): Child\r\n     {\r\n         $this->games = $games;\r\n        return $this;\r\n     }\r\n```\r\n### **constructor denormalization**\r\n\r\n- However for the other case: the **constructor denormalization**: the function **instatiateObject** from the **AbstractNormalizer** class is being executed and there there are no check on the type collection  `$params[] = $parameterData;` ==> that line exactly is responsible of giving me back an array of attributes instead of creating an object from the class **Game** which I really found a bad behaviour and mis-leading.\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce**  \r\nJust setting a Child class with an attribute games which is an array of Game objects. And a class Game with some attributes. And then A Json Object that represents a child objects with a related array of games is enough to reproduces this behaviour.\r\nA hint for the JSON:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"name\": \"test-boy\",\r\n\t\"age\": 12,\r\n\t\"games\": [{\r\n\t\t\"name\": \"Age of Empire\",\r\n\t\t\"genre\": \"Strategy\"\r\n\t}]\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Possible Solution**  \r\nThe possible solution is to implement a collection verification as it is implemented on the first case (setter denormalization) would be enough I guess to fix this behaviour.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/28078","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/28078/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/28078/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/28078/events","html_url":"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/28078","id":345191474,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDUxOTE0NzQ=","number":28078,"title":"Feature Request: Enhance Env var processing with recursive env var resolution","user":{"login":"bendavies","id":625392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTM5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/625392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendavies","html_url":"https://github.com/bendavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendavies/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99863,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTg2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/labels/DependencyInjection","name":"DependencyInjection","color":"DDDDDD","default":false},{"id":100378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02e10c","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-07-27T11:28:33Z","updated_at":"2018-07-29T14:03:35Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Description**  \r\nAs an enhancement to https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/23901, It would be nice to support recursive env var resolution.

me.\r\n\r\ncc @nicolas-grekas \r\n\r\n**Example**  \r\nGiven environment

is not.\r\n\r\n**Current Workaround**  \r\nYou must instead use an intermediary

This PR is mostly a direct port to move the discussion to Symfony core.\r\n\r\n## What this PR is about\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1047696/43195744-39867464-9006-11e8-974c-a73b446db3c0.png)\r\n\r\n### Live demo\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/r30g4boL/5/ \r\n\r\nHowever, there's a big technical limitation. We cant really tell if the output is truly intended HTML, and as such the hidden HTML comments we're adding could break things. And it does :) hence WIP.\r\n\r\nThis must be handled server-side, and to make it really robust i want to propose the following steps to finalize this;\r\n\r\n### Twig bundle configuration\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ntwig:\r\n    html_debug:\r\n        enabled: false # for BC\r\n        included: ['*.html.twig']\r\n        excluded: []\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `included` filter reduces most of the unwanted templates, and can be further downsized using the `excluded` filter. E.g. webprofiler would prepend it's own templates here, to effectively disable HTML debugging globally.\r\n\r\n### Twig syntax\r\n\r\nAt least the following block will break forms:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/0eea07752211f464818a54efc7907e8ca4c617a6/src/Symfony/Bridge/Twig/Resources/views/Form/bootstrap_3_horizontal_layout.html.twig#L58-L60\r\n\r\nBut also something like `<title>{% block title %}Welcome!{% endblock %}</title>` leads to unwanted HTML comments.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this per case we need some modifier at the syntax level, so the developer can clarify the intend, think:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{% invisible %} ... {% endinvisble %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny block etc. within this boundary is free from HTML debug comments wrapped arround it.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/28054","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/28054/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/28054/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/28054/events","html_url":"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/28054","id":343988326,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDM5ODgzMjY=","number":28054,"title":"Swoole
